    <!-- SECTION 1: INTRO -->
    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Before you can identify minerals, classify rocks, or understand the rock cycle, you need to know 
            what a mineral actually is. This seems simple — but in Science Olympiad, precision matters. 
            A mineral is not just “a rock” or “a crystal.” It has a strict scientific definition, and 
            every part of that definition is testable.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this lesson, you’ll learn the **five criteria** that define a mineral, explore common 
            misconceptions, and build the foundation for all future lessons.
        </p>

    <!-- SECTION 2: THE FIVE CRITERIA -->
    <section>
        <h2>2. The Five Criteria of a Mineral</h2>
        <p>
            A substance must meet <strong>all five</strong> of these criteria to be considered a mineral:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Naturally Occurring</strong> — Not made by humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Inorganic</strong> — Not made by living organisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Solid</strong> — Must be solid at standard temperature and pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Definite Chemical Composition</strong> — Has a specific chemical formula.</li>
            <li><strong>Ordered Internal Structure</strong> — Atoms arranged in a repeating pattern (crystalline).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why each criterion matters</h3>

        <p><strong>1. Naturally Occurring</strong><br>
        Substances created in a lab (e.g., synthetic diamonds) are not minerals, even if they look identical.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Inorganic</strong><br>
        Anything produced by life — shells, pearls, wood — is excluded.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Solid</strong><br>
        Mercury is a metal, but because it is liquid at room temperature, it is not a mineral.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Definite Chemical Composition</strong><br>
        Quartz is always SiO₂. Halite is always NaCl. This consistency is key for identification.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Ordered Internal Structure</strong><br>
        This is what gives minerals their crystal shapes, cleavage, and many physical properties.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3: NON-MINERALS -->
    <section>
        <h2>3. Common Non‑Minerals (Trick Examples)</h2>
        <p>
            Science Olympiad loves to test your understanding by giving you substances that look like minerals 
            but fail one or more criteria.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Obsidian</strong> — volcanic glass; no crystal structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Coal</strong> — organic; formed from plant matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Pearl</strong> — organic; produced by oysters.</li>
            <li><strong>Amber</strong> — fossilized tree resin; organic.</li>
            <li><strong>Opal</strong> — lacks a true crystalline structure (amorphous).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These appear constantly in competitions — knowing why they are not minerals gives you a huge advantage.

        <h2>5. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            A strong grasp of the five criteria for minerals, and how minerals differ from mineraloids and other non‑minerals, will make identification and classification straightforward in competition.
