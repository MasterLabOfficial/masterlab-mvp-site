        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Igneous rocks form from the cooling and solidification of molten material—magma or lava. 
            They are the starting point of the rock cycle and are heavily tested in Science Olympiad.
            In this lesson, you’ll learn how igneous rocks are classified, how texture and composition
            work together, and how to quickly identify common specimens in competition.

    <!-- SECTION 2: INTRUSIVE VS EXTRUSIVE -->
    <section>
        <h2>2. Intrusive vs Extrusive Igneous Rocks</h2>
        <p>
            Igneous rocks are first divided by where they solidify.
        </p>

        <h3>Intrusive (Plutonic)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Form below Earth’s surface from slowly cooled magma.</li>
            <li>Crystals have time to grow → coarse‑grained texture.</li>
            <li>Examples: granite, diorite, gabbro.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Extrusive (Volcanic)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Form at or near the surface from rapidly cooled lava.</li>
            <li>Crystals are small or invisible → fine‑grained or glassy.</li>
            <li>Examples: basalt, rhyolite, andesite, obsidian, pumice, scoria.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3: TEXTURE -->
    <section>
        <h2>3. Igneous Rock Textures</h2>
        <p>
            Texture describes the size and arrangement of crystals or fragments in the rock.
            It is one of the fastest ways to classify igneous rocks.
        </p>

        <h3>Common Textures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phaneritic</strong> — coarse‑grained; crystals visible (intrusive).</li>
            <li><strong>Aphanitic</strong> — fine‑grained; crystals too small to see (extrusive).</li>
            <li><strong>Porphyritic</strong> — large crystals in a finer matrix (two‑stage cooling).</li>
            <li><strong>Glassy</strong> — no crystals; rapid cooling (obsidian).</li>
            <li><strong>Vesicular</strong> — full of gas bubbles (pumice, scoria).</li>
            <li><strong>Pyroclastic</strong> — made of volcanic fragments and ash (tuff, volcanic breccia).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4: COMPOSITION -->
    <section>
        <h2>4. Igneous Rock Composition</h2>
        <p>
            Composition describes what minerals (and therefore what elements) dominate the rock.
            It is usually grouped into four main categories.
        </p>

        <h3>Felsic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High in silica (SiO₂), rich in feldspar and quartz.</li>
            <li>Light‑colored: pink, white, light gray.</li>
            <li>Examples: granite (intrusive), rhyolite (extrusive).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Intermediate</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Between felsic and mafic in composition and color.</li>
            <li>Medium gray, salt‑and‑pepper appearance.</li>
            <li>Examples: diorite (intrusive), andesite (extrusive).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mafic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rich in magnesium and iron (Mg + Fe).</li>
            <li>Dark‑colored: dark gray, black, greenish.</li>
            <li>Examples: gabbro (intrusive), basalt (extrusive).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ultramafic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Very high in Mg and Fe, very low in silica.</li>
            <li>Usually dark green to black.</li>
            <li>Example: peridotite (often mantle rock).</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 5: TEXTURE + COMPOSITION CHART -->
    <section>
        <h2>5. Texture + Composition Classification</h2>
        <p>
            In competition, you often classify igneous rocks by combining texture and composition.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Pairs to Know</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Granite</strong> — coarse‑grained, felsic, intrusive.</li>
            <li><strong>Rhyolite</strong> — fine‑grained, felsic, extrusive.</li>
            <li><strong>Diorite</strong> — coarse‑grained, intermediate, intrusive.</li>
            <li><strong>Andesite</strong> — fine‑grained, intermediate, extrusive.</li>
            <li><strong>Gabbro</strong> — coarse‑grained, mafic, intrusive.</li>
            <li><strong>Basalt</strong> — fine‑grained, mafic, extrusive.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Memorizing these pairs makes igneous ID much faster during timed events.

    <section>
        <h2>6. Special Igneous Rocks</h2>
        <p>
            Some igneous rocks are especially distinctive and show up frequently in Science Olympiad.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Obsidian</strong> — glassy, usually black, conchoidal fracture.</li>
            <li><strong>Pumice</strong> — light‑colored, vesicular, often floats in water.</li>
            <li><strong>Scoria</strong> — dark, vesicular, heavier than pumice.</li>
            <li><strong>Tuff</strong> — pyroclastic, made of ash and small fragments.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 7: IGNEOUS ROCKS IN THE ROCK CYCLE -->
    <section>
        <h2>7. Igneous Rocks in the Rock Cycle</h2>
        <p>
            Igneous rocks form from melted material, but they don’t stay that way forever.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weathering and erosion can break them down into sediment.</li>
            <li>Heat and pressure can transform them into metamorphic rocks.</li>
            <li>They can be remelted to form new igneous rocks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Understanding where igneous rocks fit in the rock cycle helps you answer process‑based questions.

    <!-- SECTION 9: SUMMARY -->
    <section>
        <h2>9. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Igneous rocks are classified by both texture and composition. 
            Knowing whether a rock is intrusive or extrusive, coarse‑ or fine‑grained, 
            and felsic, intermediate, mafic, or ultramafic allows you to quickly identify 
            most igneous specimens on the Rocks & Minerals list. 
            With practice, these patterns become automatic during competition.
