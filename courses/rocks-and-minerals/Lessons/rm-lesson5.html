    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation, compaction, and cementation of sediments, 
            or from chemical and biological processes. They record Earth’s surface conditions and 
            often contain fossils, making them extremely important in both geology and Science Olympiad.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this lesson, you’ll learn how sedimentary rocks are classified, how to recognize 
            common types, and how to use texture and composition to quickly identify them in competition.
        </p>

    <!-- SECTION 2: HOW SEDIMENTARY ROCKS FORM -->
    <section>
        <h2>2. How Sedimentary Rocks Form</h2>
        <p>
            Most sedimentary rocks form through a series of steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weathering</strong> — breaking down rocks into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Erosion & Transport</strong> — moving sediment by water, wind, ice, or gravity.</li>
            <li><strong>Deposition</strong> — sediment settles out of the transporting medium.</li>
            <li><strong>Compaction</strong> — layers build up and press down on lower layers.</li>
            <li><strong>Cementation</strong> — minerals precipitate from water and glue grains together.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Together, compaction and cementation are called <strong>lithification</strong>.
        </p>

    <!-- SECTION 3: CLASTIC SEDIMENTARY ROCKS -->
    <section>
        <h2>3. Clastic Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
        <p>
            Clastic (or detrital) sedimentary rocks are made of fragments of pre‑existing rocks.
            They are primarily classified by grain size.
        </p>

        <h3>Grain Size Categories</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conglomerate</strong> — rounded gravel‑sized clasts.</li>
            <li><strong>Breccia</strong> — angular gravel‑sized clasts.</li>
            <li><strong>Sandstone</strong> — sand‑sized grains; can be quartz‑rich or feldspathic.</li>
            <li><strong>Siltstone</strong> — silt‑sized grains; feels slightly gritty.</li>
            <li><strong>Shale</strong> — clay‑sized particles; splits into thin layers (fissile).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In competition, recognizing grain size and rounding is key to identifying clastic rocks.
        </p>

    <!-- SECTION 4: CHEMICAL SEDIMENTARY ROCKS -->
    <section>
        <h2>4. Chemical Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
        <p>
            Chemical sedimentary rocks form when minerals precipitate directly from solution, 
            often as water evaporates or changes chemistry.
        </p>

        <h3>Common Types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rock Salt</strong> — made of halite (NaCl); forms from evaporating seawater or lakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Rock Gypsum</strong> — made of gypsum; also forms in evaporite settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Chert</strong> — microcrystalline quartz; can form chemically or from silica‑rich fluids.</li>
            <li><strong>Travertine</strong> — banded calcite deposited from hot springs or caves.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 5: BIOCHEMICAL / ORGANIC SEDIMENTARY ROCKS -->
    <section>
        <h2>5. Biochemical and Organic Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
        <p>
            These rocks form from the remains of organisms or from biologically mediated processes.
        </p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Limestone (fossiliferous)</strong> — made of shell fragments (calcite); reacts with acid.</li>
            <li><strong>Coquina</strong> — loosely cemented shell fragments; very obvious in hand sample.</li>
            <li><strong>Chalk</strong> — soft, white, made of microscopic calcite shells.</li>
            <li><strong>Coal</strong> — formed from compressed plant material; black, lightweight, often shiny or dull.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 6: SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES -->
    <section>
        <h2>6. Sedimentary Structures</h2>
        <p>
            Sedimentary structures provide clues about the environment where the rock formed.
        </p>

        <h3>Important Structures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stratification (bedding)</strong> — visible layers; very common.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross‑bedding</strong> — angled layers; often formed by dunes or river channels.</li>
            <li><strong>Ripple marks</strong> — small ridges formed by water or wind movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Mud cracks</strong> — polygonal cracks from drying mud; indicate wet‑dry cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>Graded bedding</strong> — grain size changes from bottom to top; often from turbidity currents.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 7: FOSSILS IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS -->
    <section>
        <h2>7. Fossils in Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
        <p>
            Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks because these rocks form at Earth’s surface 
            under relatively low temperatures and pressures.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fossils can indicate past environments (marine, river, swamp, etc.).</li>
            <li>Coal suggests lush, swampy conditions with abundant plant life.</li>
            <li>Marine fossils in limestone indicate shallow seas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In Science Olympiad, recognizing fossil‑bearing rocks can help answer interpretation questions.
        </p>

    <!-- SECTION 8: SEDIMENTARY ROCKS IN THE ROCK CYCLE -->
    <section>
        <h2>8. Sedimentary Rocks in the Rock Cycle</h2>
        <p>
            Sedimentary rocks form at or near Earth’s surface, but they can be transformed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Burial and heating can turn them into metamorphic rocks.</li>
            <li>They can be uplifted, weathered, and recycled into new sediment.</li>
            <li>They can be subducted and melted, eventually forming igneous rocks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Understanding these pathways helps with process‑based questions on the test.

    <!-- SECTION 10: SUMMARY -->
    <section>
        <h2>10. Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Sedimentary rocks are classified by how they form and by grain size, composition, and structures. 
            Clastic, chemical, and biochemical/organic rocks each have distinct features that make them 
            identifiable in competition. With practice, you’ll be able to quickly recognize common sedimentary 
            rocks and use their features to infer past environments.
