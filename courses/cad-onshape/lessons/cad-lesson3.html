<h1>CAD Lesson 3 – Sketch Strategy & Construction Geometry</h1>

<p>
    Good models start with clean sketches. This lesson focuses on how to plan sketches,
    use construction geometry, and avoid messy, overcomplicated profiles.
</p>

<h2>Sketch Planning</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Start with the simplest shape that represents the main form.</li>
    <li>Add detail with additional features, not one giant sketch.</li>
    <li>Use centerlines to control symmetry and dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Construction Geometry</h2>
<p>
    Construction lines (often dashed) are used for references, not solid edges.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use construction lines for centers, axes, and symmetry.</li>
    <li>Dimension to construction geometry to keep sketches clean.</li>
    <li>Onshape shortcut: toggle construction with <strong>Q</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Too many entities in one sketch.</li>
    <li>Using edges of features instead of reference geometry.</li>
    <li>Leaving sketches underdefined (blue) when they matter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick Check</h2>
<ol>
    <li>What is construction geometry used for?</li>
    <li>Why is it better to use multiple simple sketches than one huge one?</li>
    <li>How can centerlines help with symmetry?</li>
</ol>
