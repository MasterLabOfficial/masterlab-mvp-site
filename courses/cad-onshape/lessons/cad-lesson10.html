<h1>CAD Lesson 10 – Common Mistakes & Competition Strategy</h1>

<p>
    This lesson focuses on avoiding common CAD mistakes and thinking strategically
    during timed events like Science Olympiad.
</p>

<h2>Common Modeling Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Underdefined sketches (blue) on critical features.</li>
    <li>Over‑reliance on edges instead of reference geometry.</li>
    <li>One giant sketch instead of multiple simple ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Onshape Pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Forgetting to select the correct Part Studio or Assembly tab.</li>
    <li>Misusing mates, causing over‑constrained assemblies.</li>
    <li>Not naming features or parts, making models hard to read.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competition Strategy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Model simple but clean—don't chase unnecessary detail.</li>
    <li>Use patterns, symmetry, and variables to move faster.</li>
    <li>Know your shortcuts: D, L, C, R, T, N, F, Q.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick Check</h2>
<ol>
    <li>What is one common sketching mistake?</li>
    <li>How can naming features help in competition?</li>
    <li>Why is design intent important under time pressure?</li>
</ol>
