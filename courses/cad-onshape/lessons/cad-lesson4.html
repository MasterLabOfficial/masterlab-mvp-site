<h1>CAD Lesson 4 – Core 3D Features: Extrude, Revolve, Cut</h1>

<p>
    Once sketches are ready, you turn them into 3D geometry using features.
    The most important ones in Onshape are Extrude, Revolve, and various Cut options.
</p>

<h2>Extrude</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Turns a 2D sketch into a 3D solid or cut.</li>
    <li>Key options: <strong>Blind</strong>, <strong>Symmetric</strong>, <strong>Up to Next</strong>, <strong>Through All</strong>.</li>
    <li>Can add material (solid) or remove material (cut).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Revolve</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rotates a sketch profile around an axis.</li>
    <li>Used for round parts: shafts, knobs, wheels, bottles.</li>
    <li>Requires an axis of revolution (often a centerline).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cut Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Extrude Remove: cuts material using a sketch.</li>
    <li>Revolve Remove: cuts by revolving a profile.</li>
    <li>Use "Through All" to guarantee cuts fully pass through.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick Check</h2>
<ol>
    <li>When would you use Revolve instead of Extrude?</li>
    <li>What does "Through All" do in an extrude cut?</li>
    <li>What is required to create a Revolve feature?</li>
</ol>

    { term: "Extrude", def: "A 3D feature that adds or removes material by extending a 2D sketch linearly." },
    { term: "Revolve", def: "A 3D feature that creates material by rotating a 2D profile around an axis." },
    { term: "Blind Extrude", def: "An extrusion with a specified depth, not extending through the entire part." },
