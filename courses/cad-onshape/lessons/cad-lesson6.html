<h1>CAD Lesson 6 – Assemblies & Mates in Onshape</h1>

<p>
    Assemblies show how parts fit and move together. In Onshape, you use mates
    to define relationships between parts.
</p>

<h2>Part Studios vs Assemblies</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Part Studio:</strong> Where you create parts.</li>
    <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> Where you bring parts together and define motion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Mates</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fastened:</strong> No movement between parts.</li>
    <li><strong>Revolute:</strong> Rotational motion around one axis.</li>
    <li><strong>Slider:</strong> Linear motion along one axis.</li>
    <li><strong>Cylindrical:</strong> Rotation + sliding along an axis.</li>
    <li><strong>Planar:</strong> Sliding in a plane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mate Connectors</h2>
<p>
    Onshape uses mate connectors as reference points for mates.
    Choosing good mate connector locations makes assemblies easier to control.
</p>

<h2>Quick Check</h2>
<ol>
    <li>What is the difference between a Part Studio and an Assembly?</li>
    <li>Which mate would you use for a door hinge?</li>
    <li>What does a Fastened mate allow?</li>
</ol>
