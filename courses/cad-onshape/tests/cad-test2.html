            { q: "What is design intent?", a: ["The shape of the final part", "The reasoning behind design choices and constraints", "The time it takes to model", "The number of features used"], c: 1 },
            { q: "What is parametric modeling?", a: ["Using parameters and variables to control dimensions", "Drawing flat 2D shapes", "Creating multiple assemblies", "Making detailed textures"], c: 0 },
            { q: "An Equal constraint makes:", a: ["Two lines have the same length", "Two circles have the same radius", "Multiple entities have the same size/dimension", "A shape symmetric"], c: 2 },
            { q: "What does a Symmetric constraint do?", a: ["Makes two elements mirror across an axis", "Makes two elements the same size", "Constrains an angle", "Aligns elements in a line"], c: 0 },
            { q: "Why should you use patterns instead of creating features individually?", a: ["It's faster and ensures consistency", "Patterns are only for circles", "Individual features are always better", "Patterns cannot be edited"], c: 0 },
            { q: "What is the best practice for naming features?", a: ["Use generic names like 'Feature1'", "Use descriptive names that explain the feature's purpose", "Names don't matter in CAD", "Always use single-letter names"], c: 1 },
            { q: "Which is a best practice in CAD?", a: ["Use one giant sketch for everything", "Create many simple, well-organized features", "Don't use constraints", "Avoid using reference geometry"], c: 1 },
            { q: "What does parametric design allow you to do?", a: ["Change one dimension and update the entire model", "Only change sketches", "Delete features instantly", "Work offline only"], c: 0 },
            { q: "In parametric modeling, what happens when you change a base dimension?", a: ["Nothing—you must rebuild manually", "All dependent dimensions automatically update", "Only that feature changes", "The entire model is deleted"], c: 1 },
            { q: "How does good design intent help during competitions?", a: ["It has no effect", "You can quickly iterate and adapt models to changing requirements", "It slows down the process", "It only applies to prints"], c: 1 }
