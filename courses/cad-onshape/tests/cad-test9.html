            { q: "What is the purpose of a technical drawing?", a: ["For decoration", "To communicate how a part should be manufactured", "Only for reference", "No real purpose"], c: 1 },
            { q: "Which views are part of standard orthographic projection?", a: ["Isometric only", "Front, Top, Right", "Any views you choose", "Only one view"], c: 1 },
            { q: "When should you include an isometric view in a drawing?", a: ["Never", "Always", "For 3D clarity when orthographic views might confuse", "Only in assemblies"], c: 2 },
            { q: "What is a key dimensioning rule?", a: ["Dimension random edges", "Dimension important features, not arbitrary edges", "Use as many dimensions as possible", "Avoid dimensions on critical features"], c: 1 },
            { q: "Why should you avoid duplicating dimensions?", a: ["It saves time", "It's acceptable", "It creates confusion and manufacturing errors", "Duplicates don't matter"], c: 2 },
            { q: "Where should dimensions ideally be placed?", a: ["Anywhere on the page", "Outside the part when possible", "Inside the part always", "Only on top"], c: 1 },
            { q: "What is the purpose of a hole callout annotation?", a: ["Decoration", "To specify hole size, type, and depth for drilled or tapped holes", "No purpose in modern CAD", "To label the part"], c: 1 },
            { q: "What information should material notes include?", a: ["Color preference", "Material type, finish, and special instructions", "Only the thickness", "No notes are necessary"], c: 1 },
            { q: "What is the difference between isometric and orthographic views?", a: ["They show the same information", "Orthographic is 2D from different angles; Isometric is a 3D perspective", "Isometric is always larger", "There is no real difference"], c: 1 },
            { q: "Why do dimensioning standards matter?", a: ["They don't", "They ensure clear, consistent communication across manufacturers", "Standards vary by person", "Only manufacturers care about standards"], c: 1 }
