            { q: "What is the first step in sketch planning?", a: ["Add every possible detail", "Create construction geometry", "Start with the simplest shape representing the main form", "Dimension everything"], c: 2 },
            { q: "What are construction lines used for?", a: ["Final edges of the shape", "References, not solid edges", "Hiding unwanted geometry", "Creating patterns"], c: 1 },
            { q: "In Onshape, how do you toggle construction geometry?", a: ["Press Q", "Press C", "Press D", "Right-click and select"], c: 0 },
            { q: "What does an underdefined sketch look like in Onshape?", a: ["Black", "Blue", "Red", "Green"], c: 1 },
            { q: "Why is it better to use multiple simple sketches instead of one giant sketch?", a: ["It takes longer", "It's easier to modify, debug, and understand", "Large sketches are stronger", "There is no difference"], c: 1 },
            { q: "What is a centerline primarily used for?", a: ["Creating external edges", "Strengthening the model", "Controlling symmetry and references", "Adding material"], c: 2 },
            { q: "What is one common sketching mistake?", a: ["Using too few constraints", "Using construction geometry correctly", "Having too many entities in one sketch", "Fully defining sketches"], c: 2 },
            { q: "What does an overdefined sketch indicate?", a: ["Too many features", "Conflicting constraints", "The model is complete", "The sketch is ready to extrude"], c: 1 },
            { q: "When should you use reference geometry in a sketch?", a: ["Never", "Only for final edges", "For centers, axes, and symmetry control", "Only in assemblies"], c: 2 },
            { q: "Why should dimensions be applied to construction geometry instead of edges?", a: ["It prevents future changes", "It keeps sketches clean and more robust to edits", "Construction geometry is always correct", "Edges cannot be dimensioned"], c: 1 }
