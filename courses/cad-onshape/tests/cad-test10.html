            { q: "What is a common sketching mistake under time pressure?", a: ["Over-constraining everything", "Leaving important sketches underdefined (blue)", "Using too much reference geometry", "All constraints are bad"], c: 1 },
            { q: "Why is over-reliance on part edges a problem?", a: ["Edges are the strongest references", "If the part changes, references to edges break or shift unpredictably", "Edges are always stable", "Part edges are the best practice"], c: 1 },
            { q: "What happens if you create one giant sketch instead of multiple simple ones?", a: ["It's more efficient", "It becomes hard to debug, edit, and understand", "One giant sketch is best practice", "There is no difference"], c: 1 },
            { q: "A common Onshape pitfall is:", a: ["Saving too often", "Forgetting to select the correct Part Studio or Assembly tab", "Using too many features", "All of Onshape's features are bad"], c: 1 },
            { q: "What error results from poor mate design in assemblies?", a: ["Parts don't move", "Over-constrained assemblies that fight each other or won't solve", "Under-constrained is always fine", "Mates cannot fail"], c: 1 },
            { q: "Why is naming features important in competition?", a: ["Names are cosmetic only", "Clear names make models readable and easier to edit quickly", "Naming slows you down", "Names don't affect the model"], c: 1 },
            { q: "In competition, what should you prioritize?", a: ["Maximum detail", "Simple, clean models that work—detail comes later if time allows", "Complex features", "Aesthetics over function"], c: 1 },
            { q: "Which of these Onshape shortcuts is useful?", a: ["Q", "D", "F", "All of the above"], c: 3 },
            { q: "How can variables help you move faster in competition?", a: ["They don't—they slow you down", "Change one variable and the entire model updates instantly", "Variables only work in drawings", "Variables are only for documentation"], c: 1 },
            { q: "What is the ultimate goal of good CAD practice during competition?", a: ["Make the most detailed model", "Build a flexible, robust model that adapts quickly to changes", "Use every feature available", "Speed is only thing that matters"], c: 1 }
